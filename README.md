# Relm Hypervisor 

**Relm** is an x86_64 hypervisor built to manage guest operating systems with minimal overhead. Running as a native Linux kernel module, it utilizes Intel’s hardware-assisted virtualization (VT-x) to achieve near-native execution speeds. The hypervisor also implements Extended Page Tables (EPT) for efficient second-level address translation and APIC virtualization to handle interrupt delivery and management for guest operating systems.
